## Weight Loss & Diet

According to the USA guidelines, weight loss treatment is recommended for subjects with BMI>30 and subjects with BMI between 25 and 29.9 or for subjects with high risk waist circumference and at least two risk factors. The aim of treatment is to reduce body weight with an initial weight loss of 10% and consequent loss of 0.5-1 kg each week and and to maintain a lower weight for the long term [[1]](https://europepmc.org/article/med/21681163).

If you want to lose 1 kg each week (i.e., 7700CAL), than you need to reduce your daily calorie intake by 7700/7=1100CAL. This is equivalent to 1100/2000=0.55 of your daily calorie intake.

The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is calculated as follows using Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:

For men:

$$
\text{BMR} = 10\times \text{weight} + 6.25\times \text{height} - 5\times \text{age} + 5
$$

For women:

$$
\text{BMR} = 10\times \text{weight} + 6.25\times \text{height} - 5\times \text{age} -161
$$

where weight is in kg, height is in cm, and age is in years.

If you were 22 years old, 175cm tall, and 72kg, your basic metabolic energy would be $\text{BMR} = 10\times175 + 6.25\times 72 - 5\times 22 + 5= 1708.75 \approx 1709\text{CAL}$. If I want to burn 500CAL each day by exercise, the intake should be no more than $1709-500=1209\text{CAL}$. Let's set $\text{Carbohydrate}: \text{Protein}: \text{Fat} = 5:3:2$, then the intake should be no more than 151.1g for carbohydrate, 90.7g for protein, and 26.9g for fat.
